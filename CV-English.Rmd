aboutme: "I am interested in political and global affairs, especially regarding radicalization and social movements. Currently, I'm working on my undergraduate research project, which seeks to answer whether current voting behaviour in Brazil results from distribute or identity politics. I believe my academic and professional experiences as well as my enthusiasm in further developing my career bring noteworthy qualifications for this internship."
